# Video Call Appointment Booking - Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the video call appointment booking system to ensure it follows the exact same steps as the in-person appointment booking process.

## Issues Identified
1. **Inconsistent booking flow**: Video call appointments were not following the same step-by-step process as in-person appointments
2. **Missing appointment type indication**: Users weren't clearly informed they were booking video/virtual appointments
3. **Unclear user experience**: The booking process wasn't providing sufficient feedback about the appointment type

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Booking Flow
Both video call and in-person appointments now follow the exact same 4-step process:

**Step 1: Choose Doctor**
- Video call: `video-call-appointment.html`
- In-person: `in-person-appointment.html`

**Step 2: Patient Details**
- Both use: `patient_details.html`

**Step 3: Problem Description**
- Both use: `problem-description.html`

**Step 4: Payment**
- Both use: `payment.html`

### 2. Enhanced Visual Indicators

#### Patient Details Page (`patient_details.html`)
- Added appointment type badge in the doctor information card
- Badge displays "Video Call Appointment" or "In-Person Appointment" with appropriate colors
- Video call badge: Blue gradient (`#007bff` to `#6610f2`)
- In-person badge: Green gradient (`#28a745` to `#20c997`)
